/**

  <TODO>
  - bug fix
    - it should be able to text the most recent user that signed in.
      - do we need to save all the past users? maybe just current user is okay?
    - update user info using PUT method instead of using POST so it won't make duplicates.
    - why working for only Shan's phone?

  - improvement
    - consistent user info save/retrieval from DB from the first page.

  - Deployment
    - DB : firebase is better(no cost, no API implementation, easier, no server)
    - Heroku or firebase. 
      
  - Native conversion
    - Convering an app to Native using Corvoda/Ionic
